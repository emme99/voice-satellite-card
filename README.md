# voice-satellite-card
A Home Assistant custom card that turns your browser into a fully-featured   voice satellite using **openWakeWord** running locally in the browser   (via ONNX Runtime Web/WASM). It integrates directly with Home Assistant's   Assist Pipeline for local wake word detection and maximum privacy.
